## What I'm Up To These Days

**üß† Natural Language Processing**  
I'm really into building systems that can understand human language better. Been working with various NLP APIs and creating solutions that work in real scenarios.

**ü§ñ Playing with Generative AI**  
The whole GPT and Gemini ecosystem fascinates me! I spend a lot of time figuring out how to integrate these models into practical applications.

**üîó Exploring Vector Search & AI**  
Really excited about vector databases and how they're changing AI retrieval systems. The possibilities are endless!

## My Real Projects

### üïµÔ∏è **FakeShield: DeepFake Detection System**
Built this machine learning system to detect manipulated videos and images using CNN and RNN models. With all the fake content out there, this felt like an important problem to tackle.
**Stack:** Deep Learning, OpenCV, Python  
[Check it out](https://github.com/imthiyas25/Machine-Learning-Based-Deepfake-Detection-for-Enhanced-Media-Integrity-and-Authentication)

### üîê **StegoSecure: Image Steganography**  
Created a secure data embedding system that hides information within images using advanced cryptographic techniques. Perfect for secure communication.
**Stack:** Neural Networks, Cryptographic Algorithms  
[See the code](https://github.com/imthiyas25/Image-Steganography)

### üí¨ **ChatMate: Real-Time Chat Application**
My first big full-stack project! A real-time messaging platform with WebSocket technology. This is where I really learned web development.
**Stack:** React, Node.js, MongoDB, Socket.IO  
[Live demo](https://github.com/imthiyas25/simple-chating-app)
